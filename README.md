# Nested List Utilities

This project contains two Python functions for working with nested lists:

1. flatten() – Converts a deeply nested list into a single flat list.
2. deep_reverse() – Reverses a list and all its nested sublists recursively.

This project was prepared as part of a bootcamp organized by Akbank Gençlik Akademisi.
